## Project Overview

Signlangdetec is an open-source project that leverages computer vision and machine learning to translate standard American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into real-time captions. Built primarily in Jupyter Notebook, this project aims to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by providing instant captioning for sign language.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time ASL Detection**: Processes video input and identifies ASL gestures on the fly.
- **Caption Generation**: Converts recognized gestures into English captions in real time.
- **Jupyter Notebook Implementation**: Easy to understand, experiment with, and extend.
- **Open-Source Models**: Utilizes and/or fine-tunes pre-trained models for hand gesture and sign detection.
- **Customizable Pipeline**: Modular code for dataset preprocessing, model training, and inference.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Required Packages

Install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> If `requirements.txt` is not present, install common dependencies manually:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python mediapipe tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShubsMO6/Signlangdetec.git
    cd Signlangdetec
    ```

2. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the main notebook (e.g., `SignLanguageDetection.ipynb`) in your browser.

3. **Run the Notebook**
    - Follow the instructions in each cell.
    - Provide a camera input or use a sample video.
    - View real-time caption output as you sign.
